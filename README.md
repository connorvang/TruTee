## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Testing User and Org creation

The app uses Clerk users and organizaitions for authentication and then uses webhooks to link those to Supabase.

You will need to install NGROK (this is a temporary URL) for testing.

```bash
ngrok http --url=ideal-halibut-truly.ngrok-free.app 3000
```

You can now visit the build at https://ideal-hlibut-truly.ngrok-free.app
